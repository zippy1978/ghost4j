This package provides the two top-level interfaces to the functionality
of <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net>the cajo project</a>. The cajo
functionality consists of <i>two</i> fundamental pieces, these are
represented by the <b>Grail</b> and <b>Service</b> interfaces:

<ul>
<li>The <b>Grail</b> inteface defines the functionality for furnishing,
finding, and using objects; upon which to invoke procedure calls.<p>

<li>The <b>Service</b> interface defines the cajo proxy model. Proxies are
objects, requested from the server or sent by a client, to interact with a
service object, in a local context for a client.<p>

<li> The <b>Service.Proxy</b> interface defines the method used to pass a
client or server proxy, depending on context, a reference to a service
object over which to communicate.
</ul>

<p>The Cajo class, and its helper classes, exist purely to implement the
Grail interface. The cajo project website provides a short and
simple <a href=http://weblogs.java.net/blog/cajo/archive/2007/09/simple_interjvm.html>
example<a> of the use of the package.
