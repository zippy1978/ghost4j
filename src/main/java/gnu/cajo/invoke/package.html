This package is the foundation for completely transparent local/remote
inter-VM communication. It provides a standard interface between local/remote
objects, and prevents having to generate unique RMI stubs for every
application specific class. <i>(either explicitly or implicitly)</i><p>

The rationale behind this paradim is to enable seamless dynamic and
interchangeable linking between remote and local objects; in order to
accomplish advanced functionality. Objects can also be mobile, i.e. moving
from one JVM to another, even providing graphical user interfaces to itself,
on remote hosts. Objects can even be dynamically linked, with objects from
other applications, at runtime.  This can support and harness such concepts
as scale-free networking, and the emergent phenomena of collective networking.
<p>

For the purposes of this paradigm, any object implementing the
{@link gnu.cajo.invoke.Invoke Invoke} interface is considered an
<b>Item</b>. If a JVM allows the loading of mobile code, and an item is
sent to it, either as an argument, or a return value, that item is referred
to as a <b>Proxy</b>, in this architecture.<p>

Also included in the package is the {@link gnu.cajo.invoke.Client Client}
and {@link gnu.cajo.invoke.JClient JClient} Application/Applet. While
strictly non topical to this package, they provide another standard paradigm
for creating, hosting, and using graphical proxy items. They could be likened
to a successor to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xwindows>
X Windows</a>. They are far more capable, being able to perform application
specific computation at the client, offloading the server.<p>
