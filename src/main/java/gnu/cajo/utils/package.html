A set of common utilities used by either proxy, or server items. As a general
rule, do not compile all of the utility classes blindly; rather jar any
classes resulting from the compilation of the proxy or server applications.
As a rule, a proxy hosting VM is not required to have these classes in its
classpath; therefore, the ones used from this package by a proxy application
must be included in the proxy's codebase jar file.
<p>

Fundamentally, there are two entities; clients and servers. A server is a
Virtual Machine which, at a minimum, exports one item, meaning a remotely
invokable object implementing the {@link gnu.cajo.invoke.Invoke Invoke}
interface.  A server can also provide proxies; i.e. mobile item interfaces, to
the server's local item objects (exported or not), which run inside the
client's runtime. A client is a VM that makes use of a server's items and
proxies, but need not export any of its own. The architecture readily supports
the possibility of hybrid client/server VMs.  Each VM can export as many items
as it wants.<p>

Items can transparently connect to other items across, logical, virtual or
physical separation. This package seeks to establish the following
roles between items:<p>

An item is a control element of a system, it performs three major
tasks:<ul>
  <li>control system resources
  <li>monitor system operation
  <li>log system transactions
</ul>

A proxy is a optional, item-specific, interface, designed to separate and
manage the following functions:<ul>
  <li>user input validation and feedback
  <li>item output formatting and presentation
  <li>localization and internationalization
</ul>

Any item instance can invoke a transpparently local/remote method invocation
on another. The invocation may or may not carry inbound data, and may or may
not result in a synchronous response of data.  A remote method invocation may
also initiate an asynchronous operation in the receiver, resulting in a
subsequent callback invocation from the receiver back to the client, at a
later time.<p>

<u>When the items are remote</u>; the overall network structure looks
something like this:<pre>

 --------------         --------------
|  Server VM   |       |  Client VM   |
|  ----------  | TCP   |  ----------  |
| | Item     | | links | | Proxy    | |
| |----------| |       | |----------| |
| | http     | |<------| | codebase | |
| | callback | |<------| | notify   | |
| | notify   | |------>| | callback | |
|  ----------  |       |  ----------  |
 --------------         --------------

</pre>

<i>Note:</i> Each outgoing TCP link consumes a corresponding anonymous
return link, so the following port consumption realities for a <u>server</u>
VM must be considered:

<ul>
<li>Each item consumes 2 inbound ports permanently (http / callback)
<li>Each item consumes 1 outbound short-term port per client (codebase)
<li>Each item consumes 1 outbound session-term port per client (callback)
</ul>

Therefore, it must be understood that since each connecting client
will consume 2 dynamically allocated TCP ports, therefore no more than ~64k
simultaneous clients could be served by one IP address; that is, assuming the
host had no other servers.  Therefore, for very high usage hosts, multiple
physical machines, multiple network interfaces, or a multi-homed host, would
become necessary.
