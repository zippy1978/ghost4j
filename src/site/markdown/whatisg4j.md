What is Ghost4J
===============

Ghost4J is a Java wrapper for the Ghostscript API, and more...

[Ghostscript](http://www.ghostscript.com) is a free, powerfull and widely used Postscript language (and PDF) interpreter available on multiple platforms.
However, it only provides a C API and does not provide any connection to the Java language.

Thanks to Ghost4J, it is now possible to use the full Ghostscript API in Java.

Main features
-------------

* Full Ghostscript API supported.

* Object oriented API.
      
* High level API providing a set of components (converters, analyzers, renderers) to handle Postscript and PDF documents.
      
* Multi-process support.
